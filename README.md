## Welcome to Reign of the Overlord

This is a temporary website to publish early versions of this game.

### What I'm working on

For version 0.0.4:

* Fixing game timer seconds being only single digits
* Fixing the player turret building cooldown not being applied
* Decrease map size or at least make it feel closer
* Implement boost functionality for all players (including the Overlord)
* Implement an inhibitor turret for the Protectors (former "Players") to slow down the transporters (former "Enemies")

### Get it Here!

Make sure that you and whoever you play with have the same version of the game.
